# MasterThesis
The repository contains code used for Lea Stenum Hagelskjær’s and Lotte Hvidberg Smed’s masters project. The code is based on the HFMF model presented in this respository, https://github.com/taco-group/hfmf, created by Anant Mehta, Bryant McArthur, Nagarjuna Kolloju and Zhengzhong Tu. Some slight changes have been made in order to make the code work in a colab environment, get rid of outdated packages and to solve dependency and server issues. 
For the complete guide and read me file, please go to the original repository.
